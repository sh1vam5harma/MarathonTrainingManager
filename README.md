We integrated features from Part 1, such as allowing users to find a training program that fits their desired difficulty.Â 
We were not able to implement the marathon signup due to time constraints. 
Some of the most intriguing database operations are performed on the Log Training Event page, which includes allows users to input training that 
they have completed. This allows users to keep track of the different training that they do, whether it is running, hiking, biking, etc. 
Another interesting database operation is right on the index.html homepage. 
By using operations we are able to display the results of one of the marathons from our database.
