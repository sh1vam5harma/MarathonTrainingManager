Overview

This web application is built using Python (with `psycopg2` and SQLAlchemy), Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML, and Git. It connects to a PostgreSQL database, runs queries, and serves web pages to users based on those queries. The application is designed to allow users to interact with various aspects of marathon training and racing events, with database operations managing and displaying this information.

Key Features

1. Training Program Selection:
   - Users can find a marathon training program that fits their desired difficulty level. This feature helps users to tailor their training to their specific needs and goals.

2. Log Training Event:
   - One of the most intriguing database operations is found on the "Log Training Event" page. This allows users to input the training they have completed, whether it is running, hiking, biking, etc. It provides a comprehensive way for users to track their training progress over time.

3. Marathon Results Display:
   - The homepage (`index.html`) features an interesting database operation where the results of a marathon are displayed. This provides users with an overview of race outcomes directly from the database.

4. Volunteer Signup:
   - Although not fully implemented due to time constraints, the application includes a feature for volunteers to sign up to help during a race. This aligns with the initial design plan and adds another layer of interaction for users.

Limitations
- Marathon Signup:
  - The implementation of the marathon signup feature was not completed due to time constraints. This would have allowed users to register for upcoming marathon events directly through the application.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the integration of a database-driven web application that manages and displays information related to marathon training and racing events. While some features were not fully implemented, the core functionalities offer valuable tools for users to plan, track, and engage with marathon activities.
